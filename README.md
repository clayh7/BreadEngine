# BreadEngine v1.0
This is the Engine I made while in Guildhall
I used it for:
- Homework assignments
- Thesis
- Multiplayer Game Programming book examples

# Thesis
I made an networked MMOARPG for my thesis.
All of the code, art, and design was made by me.
I made a Networking System with the following features:
- Reliable and Unreliable packages
- Ordered and Unordered packages
- Dedicated Server/Listen Server
- Supports up to ~80 people

Game features:
- 4 classes
- AI enemies / Boss
- ?? Weapons (need to check, more than 50)
- UI System / Inventory
- Input System
- Particles
- Save world game state
- Player profiles
- Leveling / Stats / Combat

# Multiplayer Game Programming
While I start reading this book, I need a place to implement the examples the book talked about so I could better learn.
Examples from the book and my own implementations can be found here
